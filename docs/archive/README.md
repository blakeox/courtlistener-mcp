## 📖 Current Documentation

For current, active documentation, see the root directory:

## 🔍 Why Archived?

These documents were created during the refactoring process to track progress and decisions. Now that the refactoring is complete, they serve as historical reference but are not needed for day-to-day development.

**The comprehensive final reports in the root directory contain all the essential information.**
