# Docker Security Updates - Legal MCP Server

## Overview
Updated all Docker images to address critical high vulnerabilities in Node.js Alpine images.

## Changes Made

### 1. Development Container (`.devcontainer/Dockerfile`)
- **Before**: `node:20-alpine`
- **After**: `node:22-alpine3.20`
- **Security Improvements**:
  - Updated to latest LTS Node.js with security patches
  - Added comprehensive security updates with `apk update && apk upgrade`
  - Added non-root user setup for better security
  - Added security certificates and timezone data
  - Cleaned package cache to reduce attack surface

### 2. Production Dockerfile (`Dockerfile`)
- **Before**: `node:18-alpine`
- **After**: `node:22-alpine3.20`
- **Security Improvements**:
  - Updated to latest LTS Node.js version
  - Added security updates and essential packages only
  - Moved user creation before dependency installation
  - Added npm cache cleaning after installation
  - Enhanced security posture with minimal package footprint

### 3. Enterprise Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.enterprise`)
- **Before**: `node:18-alpine` (both base and runtime stages)
- **After**: `node:22-alpine3.20` (both stages)
- **Security Improvements**:
  - Updated both build and runtime stages
  - Added comprehensive security updates
  - Enhanced runtime security with minimal dependencies
  - Maintained enterprise features while improving security

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Latest Stable Images**: Using Node.js 22 LTS with Alpine 3.20
2. **Security Updates**: Regular package updates with `apk update && apk upgrade`
3. **Minimal Attack Surface**: Only essential packages installed
4. **Non-Root Execution**: All containers run as non-root users
5. **Cache Cleanup**: Removed package caches to reduce image size
6. **Certificate Management**: Added CA certificates for secure connections

## Next Steps

1. **Regular Updates**: Set up automated dependency scanning
2. **Image Scanning**: Consider adding Docker image vulnerability scanning to CI/CD
3. **Security Policies**: Implement container security policies in production
4. **Monitoring**: Add runtime security monitoring for containers

## Verification

After rebuilding containers, the Docker security warnings should be resolved. The VS Code Docker extension should no longer show high vulnerability alerts.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Rebuild development container
docker compose up --build

# Rebuild production container
docker build -t legal-mcp:latest .

# Rebuild enterprise container
docker build -f Dockerfile.enterprise -t legal-mcp:enterprise .
```

**Note**: These updates address the immediate security vulnerabilities. Regular security reviews and updates should be part of the development workflow.
